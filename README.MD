This is an academic project of front-end web development, one of my first IT courses in my life.
I learnt this course for 3 months only and created this project with 2 - 3 days.

All content of this website is unreal and imagined by me.
This website contains 8 pages and was built with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The final score of this project is 100%.
